# Lab 8 - Starter

**1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.**

- [x] *Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed*
- [ ] *Manually run them locally before pushing code*
- [ ] *Run them all after all development is completed*

- I think that we should fit our automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever the code is pushed. So everytime we push code to Github, the tests will be ran, that makes the most logical sense to me.


**2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)**

- No, unit testing would be more appropriate for that.
